    "These notes are a Python-centered read-along of the excellent [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/index.html) by Rob J Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos [$^1$](#cite1).  The author of these notes is [Mike Richman](zgana.github.io).  I am about six months into my first data science job, which comes on the heels of about a decade as a Ph.D. and postdoc in neutrino astrophysics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In industry, we have to deal with timeseries data in a way that shares little in common with my past work as an academic.  Prior to this exercise, my only experience with forecasting consists of an interview take-home for a trading-related job I did not ultimately take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning methods are all the rage right now, and rightly so.  See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13408) for a recent overview.  However, until relatively recently, it was less clear that deep learning could significantly improve on mathematically straightforward models implemented by experienced forecasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an opportunity for some personal research, I decided to take the time to go through *Forecasting: Principles and Practice* in detail.  This serves two purposes.  First, as they say, you must walk before you can run; I should make sure I have the basics down before I get too deep into the latest research architectures.  Second, I did not easily come across a comparable resource based on Python."

That may result in doing some things in silly ways.  But if you follow the original text with these notes, you should rarely if ever feel like you've reached a dead end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the tools available in Python are not (or do not currently appear to be) a complete substitute for those available in R.  There are cells in these notebooks that look ridiculous compared to the R code they mimic, and I think only some of this is my fault.  Timeseries analysis is a core strength of R.  Python has different strengths.  If you love Python, or you have no choice but to use it in your work, then tolerating apparent shortcomings in its ecosystem is worth it.\n",
